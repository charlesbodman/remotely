## Prerequisites
- rsync

## Install
```
npm install -g remotely-cli
```

## Usage

**Create remotely config (`.remotely.json`)**
```
$ remotely init
```
Run this in any parent directory from where you are going to be running `remotely`.

Remotely will climb up and use the first config file it finds
[Read about config here](#config)

Make sure you edit your config (`.remotely.json`) file after doing this.

---

**Watch local directory for changes and rsync push on change**
```
$ remotely watch
```
---

**Rsync pull down remote**
```
$ remotely pull
```
---

**Rsync push to remote**
```
$ remotely push
```
---

## Config
Remotely will look for the config file `.remotely.json` in any directory above where you call `remotely [command]`.
This means that the config can belong anywhere, as long as remotely can find it by traversing upwards

| Config        | Desc         |                |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| local         | local path to sync dir | required |
| remote      | remote host and path | required |
| rsync_flags | flags to customize rsync  | optional |
| dry_run | perform dry run | optional |
| exclude | files or directories to exclude | optional |
| notify | notify when complete | optional |

**Example config**

This could live in `/Users/charliebodman/documents/example/.remotely.json`
You can create remotely config by calling `remotely init`
```javascript
{
    "local":"/Users/charliebodman/documents/example/project",
    "remote":"charlie@example.com:~/example/project"
}
```
